# DALL-E Clone

DALL-E Clone is a web application that utilizes the OpenAI API to generate images from textual prompts. It allows users to create unique and creative images by describing what they want, and the application generates visuals based on those descriptions. This project is built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack.
